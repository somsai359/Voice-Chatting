# Voice-Chatting

real-time voice communication app using Next.js for the frontend and GoLang for the backend. The application should allow two or
more users to join a common room and communicate via voice in real-time.
Objectives
Frontend (Next.js):
Create a basic user interface using Next.js where users can enter their name and join a voice chat room.
Implement real-time communication using WebSockets to handle live voice data transmission.
Manage and display the list of users currently connected to the room.
Backend (GoLang):
Develop a GoLang server that utilizes WebSockets to facilitate real-time voice data exchange between clients.
Implement Go routines to efficiently handle multiple users and data streams concurrently.
Provide endpoints for users to join/leave chat rooms and to send/receive voice data.
